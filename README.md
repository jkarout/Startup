# FitInfo 

[My Notes](notes.md)

When the user visits the website, a survey up will pop up asking about basic information. Then it will ask to select which exercise they want info about such as the bench press, squats, or even deadlifts. After they select the exercise, it will take them to another page where they'll have more information and some pictures about the exercise.



> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features
- A login page: the user would enter his information and his information will be saved 
- Pop-Up Survey Form: a simple, interactive survey that pops up when the user visits the website. It includes three basic questions(e.g, name, age, fitness level ,or fitness goals). It is ensured also that it is friendly user interface so it will have buttons such as 'next' or 'submit'.
- Exercise Selection Page: After completing the survey, the user is directed to a clean and organized exercise selection page where they will have options to choose from the main weightlifting exercises.
- Exercise Information Page: After clicking on the exercicse they want to learn about, it will take them into another page where it will display some information about the exercise, some images, and guides on how to do the exercise. This page should also have basic features such as a "Back to Exercise List" button where it takes them back to the main exercise page.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HtML will be used to structure the content of the website such as creating simple pages for the survey, exercise selection and info. Will be using things like 'header','main','section','footer' to organize content on the website logically. First Page is for the login, second is for the survey, and third is for information about the exercise.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to style the website, making it visually appealing to the user while mainting simplicity.
- **React** - React will handle the website's dynamic behavior and component-based structure. For example to navigate between page(e.g,/ survey, /exercises, /exercise-info). Also, to create resusable components like Survey Form, Exercise List, and Exercise Info Page. 
- **Service** - Services will handle logic like processing the survey or fetching exercise data. Use a simple service to submit survey responses, or fetch exercise descriptions and images for a pre-defined list or database.
- **DB/Login** - The database will stor user data like survey responses, and login functionality can personalize user experiences.
- **WebSocket** - WebSocket can be used to add real-time interactivity, such as sending feedback or updating live data. For example, I would send a welcome message to the user after he submits his survey.
